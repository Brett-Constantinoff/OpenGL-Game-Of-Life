## Description

Conways Game of Life is a game based on cellular automation which means that each generation is effected by its predecessor. This version 
uses C++ and OpenGL and incorporates my [OpenGL-Base repo](https://github.com/Brett-Constantinoff/OpenGL-Base). The cubes are instanced rendered and the main Game of Life is solved using an array which holds cell states (0 for dead 1 for alive).


A custom ray caster is used for mouse interaction which allows for clicking on a cell position and adding and removing cells.
